## Objective
Understand various control strategy by performing them with a cart-pole environment, simple yet a bit difficult control target

## Control Strategies included
- state feedback
- state feedback gain design by linear quadratic regulator
- iterative feedback tuning (currently only FRIT)
- predictive functional control
- reinforcement learning (PPO)

More strategies will be added with future commit
