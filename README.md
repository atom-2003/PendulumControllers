## Objective
Understand various control strategy by performing them with a cart-pole environment; classic, simple yet a bit difficult to control

## Control Strategies included
- state feedback
- state feedback gain design by linear quadratic regulator
- iterative feedback tuning (currently only FRIT)
- predictive functional control
- reinforcement learning (PPO)

More strategies will be added on future commit.

## Prerequisities
- Python 3.11
- Pytorch
- scipy
- numpy
- gymnasium\[mujoco\]
- stable-baslines3
- cvxpy (will be neccessary soon)
